  <h1 id= "parthenon">The Parthenon Sculptures</h1>
    <p>The Parthenon Sculptures constitute a collection of diverse marble architectural ornaments originating from the Parthenon, the temple of Athena on the Acropolis in Athens. Created between 447BC and 432BC, these artifacts include a frieze illustrating the Panathenaic festival procession, metopes depicting the Centaur and Lapith battle, and figures of gods and legendary heroes from the temple's pediments. The British Museum holds 15 metopes, 17 pedimental figures, and 247ft (75m) of the original frieze.</p>

    <p>The Parthenon, with a multifaceted history as a temple, church, mosque, and now an archaeological site, has endured significant damage over time. Notably, an explosion in 1687, when it served as an ammunition store, left it in ruins. Approximately 50% of the original architectural decorations on the Parthenon have been lost over centuries, making a complete reconstruction or reunification with its sculptural elements impossible.
      </p>

    <p>Acknowledging that the surviving sculptures are best observed and preserved in museums, a new museum in Athens, the Acropolis Museum, was established in 2009 to house the remaining sculptures in Greece, offering an in-depth exploration of the ancient history of the Acropolis and its associated religious sanctuaries and civic structures.

    <p>The Parthenon Sculptures originate from Athens, Greece, where the Parthenon was constructed in the 5th century BC, serving as a symbol of the power and dominance of ancient Athens. After Greece gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the Parthenon became an emblematic representation of the modern nation-state.
      </p>

    <p>In 1834, when Athens was designated the capital of the newly established country, significant removal of post-Roman period structures on the Acropolis took place. This was done to facilitate further archaeological exploration and restore the site to a condition that reflected Greece's idealized 'Classical' past.
      </p>

  <h3>How the British Museum CLAIMS to have received them?</h3>
      <p>By the early 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had been the governing authority in Athens for 350 years. Lord Elgin was the British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and successfully petitioned the authorities to be able to draw, measure and remove figures.
        </p>

      <p>He was granted a permit (firman), and between 1801 and 1805 acting under the oversight of the relevant authorities, Elgin removed about half of the remaining sculptures from the ruins of the Parthenon. He also obtained permission to have removed sculptural and architectural elements from other buildings on the Acropolis, namely the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Propylaia.
        </p>

      <p>All of Elgin's collection of antiquities was then transported to Britain. His actions were thoroughly investigated by a Parliamentary Select Committee in 1816 and found to be entirely legal, prior to the sculptures entering the collection of the British Museum by Act of Parliament.
        </p>



  <h1 id= "benin">The Benin Bronzes</h1>
    <p>The 'Benin Bronzes' comprise a collection of sculptures, including ornate cast plaques, commemorative heads, animal and human figures, royal regalia, and personal ornaments made of brass and bronze. Originating from the West African Kingdom of Benin since at least the 16th century, these artifacts were crafted by specialized guilds working for the royal court of the Oba (king) in Benin City. The term 'Benin Bronzes' is sometimes used to encompass objects created from other materials like ivory, leather, coral, and wood.</p>

    <p>Commissioned for ancestral altars of past Obas and Queen Mothers, the Benin Bronzes played a significant role in rituals honoring ancestors and validating the ascension of a new Oba. Notable among them are the cast brass plaques that adorned the Benin royal palace, offering a valuable historical record of the Kingdom of Benin, including dynastic and social history, as well as insights into its relationships with neighboring kingdoms.
      </p>

      <p>The Benin Bronzes depict the Kingdom's early interactions with Europeans, particularly with Portugal, dating back to the 15th century. These connections involved trade and diplomatic contacts, with emissaries traveling between Benin and Portugal to negotiate their evolving relationship.
      </p>

      <p>The British Museum houses over 900 objects from the historic Kingdom of Benin, with more than 100 displayed in rotating exhibits. These artifacts are also regularly lent to institutions worldwide. The museum's collection includes archival documentation and photographic materials related to the objects from the Kingdom of Benin and their acquisition history.

    <p>The Benin Bronzes originate from Benin City, the historical capital of the Kingdom of Benin, a prominent city-state in West Africa during the medieval period. Benin City was incorporated into the British Empire from 1897 to 1960 and is presently situated within the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
      </p>

      <p>Today, the modern city of Benin, located in Edo State, is the residence of the current ruler of the Kingdom of Benin, His Royal Majesty Oba Ewuare II. Despite the historical changes, many rituals and ceremonies associated with the Kingdom of Benin's past continue to be practiced in the present day.
        </p>

    <h3>How the British Museum CLAIMS to have received them?</h3>
    <p>By the late 19th century, British dominance in Nigeria's coastal trade led to the acquisition of the Benin Bronzes by the British Museum. This period marked the "Scramble for Africa," as European nations, armed with new military technologies, sought greater control over the continent. The transatlantic slave trade, although largely abolished by the late 19th century, had a profound impact on West African societies.
      </p>

      <p><img src="artifacts/benin-display.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="benin-display" style="float:right;width:410px;height:310px;"></p>


      <p>The clash between Britain and the Kingdom of Benin resulted from the expansion of British power and a disagreement over trading conditions. In 1897, a British trade mission was attacked, leading to a retaliatory military expedition. The occupation of Benin City was brutal, resulting in widespread destruction, pillage, and the capture of ceremonial objects, including over 900 brass plaques, vital to the Benin Court's historic records.
        </p>

      <p>In 1897, the British Museum displayed 304 Benin plaques on loan, acquiring 203 as a donation. Other plaques were sold, exchanged, or retained by the Foreign Office. Subsequent growth in the British Museum's collection involved major private acquisitions and the de-accessioning of some plaques in 1950 and 1951, mistakenly considered duplicates. Additional plaques were sold or exchanged between 1950 and 1972.
        </p>

        <p>Beyond objects linked to the 1897 expedition, the British Museum cares for items associated with Benin City, including brass castings, carved ivories, contemporary artworks, textiles, casts, replicas, and archaeological finds.
          </p>




  <h1 id= "shield">Australian Aboriginal Shield</h1>

    <p>The object in question is a shield crafted from bark and wood (specifically red mangrove), dating back to the late 1700s or early 1800s. Notably, the shield displays a hole near the center, indicative of having been struck by a spear. Currently, it is permanently exhibited in Room 1, known as The Enlightenment Gallery, at the British Museum. During 2015-2016, the shield was loaned to the National Museum of Australia for display in Canberra.

        <p>Regarding its origin, since red mangrove is not native to Sydney, it is likely that the shield comes from coastal regions further north in New South Wales. Initial speculation, based on its resemblance to a shield depicted in illustrations from Captain Cook's voyages, suggested a possible connection to Cook's visit to Botany Bay in 1770. However, subsequent research, prompted by Aboriginal community members in Sydney and conducted by Professor Nicholas Thomas of the Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology at Cambridge, indicates that the shield was not collected by Captain Cook.
          </p>

  <h3>How the British Museum CLAIMS to have received this?</h3>
      <p>The shield's journey to the British Museum lacks a detailed record. It is presumed to have reached the Museum between approximately 1790 and 1815. During this period, a multitude of objects were sent to London by colonial governors and other individuals associated with the colony at Port Jackson (Sydney). While it is uncertain, there is a possibility that the shield was sent to Joseph Banks, who had a close association with the Museum during that era.
        </p>


  <h1 id= "maqdala">Maqdala Collection</h1>
        <p>The British Museum houses approximately 80 objects from the northern Ethiopian locality of Maqdala (now Amba Mariam). In the second half of the 19th century, Emperor Tewodros II (reigned 1855–1868) constructed a fortress, library, and treasury in Maqdala.
          </p>

        <p>The collection comprises ceremonial crosses, chalices, processional umbrella tops, weapons, textiles, jewelry, archaeological artifacts, and tabots (altar tablets of high sacred significance in the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition). Objects from Maqdala are featured in permanent and changing displays within the museum's galleries. These items, many of which hold spiritual importance, also represent significant artistic traditions in Ethiopia.

        <p>Maqdala, situated as an almost impregnable mountain-top fortress in northern Ethiopia, served as the seat of power for Emperor Tewodros II. Within the confines of Maqdala, Tewodros initiated the establishment of a library, treasury, and a new church.
          </p>

        <p>Emperor Tewodros sought to consolidate control over the entire region through military campaigns. During these conquests, he collected books, holy relics, and manuscripts from various churches across Ethiopia, notably from Gondar. His intention was to make Maqdala a center for learning and research.
          </p>

        <p>Consequently, the treasury at Maqdala held a wealth of exceptional items, including silk textiles, gold and silver regalia, jewelry, weapons, liturgical vessels, processional crosses, and tabots. These artifacts represented some of the finest examples of Ethiopian cultural and religious heritage.

          <h3>How the British Museum CLAIMS to have received them?</h3>
              <p>In the 1860s, strained relations between Britain and Emperor Tewodros II escalated due to political developments and a perceived insult. Tewodros sought British military assistance, but his request was ignored, leading to the imprisonment of the British consul and other Europeans. This prompted a British military expedition in 1867, involving 13,000 soldiers led by Sir Robert Napier, with the goal of freeing hostages and punishing Tewodros. The assault in 1868 resulted in the destruction of Maqdala's fortress, Tewodros' suicide, and widespread looting. Richard Rivington Holmes, an official archaeologist accompanying the expedition, acquired a significant collection of objects, including manuscripts, regalia, and sacred items. Additional items came from Captain Speedy, who participated in the campaign and later became the guardian of Tewodros' son. The pillaging of Maqdala faced criticism, notably from British Prime Minister William Gladstone, who deemed it reprehensible.

      <h1 id= "moai">Moai Statues</h1>
        <p>The museum is responsible for the preservation of two large stone moai from Rapa Nui (Easter Island): Hoa Hakananai'a and Moai Hava. Moai, megalithic statues placed on ceremonial platforms called ahu, are considered the living faces of ancestors.
          </p>
        <p>Hoa Hakananai'a, meaning 'lost, hidden, or stolen friend,' is among approximately ten basalt-carved moai dating from around 1000–1200. The statue features intricate petroglyphs related to the birdman religion on its back. It is permanently displayed in Room 24 as part of the Living and Dying exhibition.
          </p>

        <p>Moai Hava, translated as 'dirty, repudiated, rejected, or lost,' dates between 1100–1600 and is crafted from volcanic tuff, commonly used for moai and sourced mainly from the Rano Raraku quarry. Carved to depict arms, torso, and head, Moai Hava includes hands and a loin cloth at the bottom of the torso. While not currently on permanent display, Moai Hava can be accessed by appointment as part of the museum's study collection. In recent years, it has been lent to various museums for exhibitions.
          </p>

        <p>Hoa Hakananai'a and Moai Hava originated from Rapa Nui (Easter Island), also known as Te Pito o Te Henua ('the navel of the World'). The island was settled by skilled Polynesian navigators around 1000 and was annexed by Chile in 1888.

        <p>Hoa Hakananai'a was initially buried up to its shoulders in a house called Taura Renga at the ceremonial village of Orongo near Rano Kau. It is believed that this moai might have stood on a ceremonial platform (ahu) before its ritual function changed. Inside the ceremonial house at Orongo, the statue gained stronger associations with the tangata manu, or birdman religion, which emerged around 1400, well after Hoa Hakananai'a was carved. Orongo served as the focal point for the new ritual, involving a competition among Rapanui chiefly groups to obtain the first egg of the sooty tern from the nearby islet of Motu Nui. The victorious chief became the tangata manu (birdman) and represented the patron god of the royal lineage for one year.
          </p>

        <p>Moai Hava was buried in the ancient gathering place of clans near burial sites, now known as Mataveri.
          </p>

          <h3>How the British Museum CLAIMS to have received them?</h3>
              <p>In 1868, the crew of the British survey ship HMS Topaze visited Rapa Nui. During their visit, they located Moai Hava at Mataveri, collecting it on November 2, 1868. Shortly after, while searching the village of Orongo, two crew members discovered Hoa Hakananai'a. Commodore Richard Powell decided to excavate this second moai with the intention of taking both to Britain. Hoa Hakananai'a was transported on a sledge to the shore, then floated on a raft to the ship with the assistance of Rapanui locals.
                </p>
              <p>Upon the ship's return to England in 1869, Hoa Hakananai'a was presented to Queen Victoria by the Admiralty, which had learned of its existence from Commodore Powell. Queen Victoria subsequently donated Hoa Hakananai'a to the British Museum. On October 6, 1869, the arrival of the statue at the Museum marked the beginning of a new chapter in its complex history. Moai Hava, also brought by HMS Topaze, was directly donated to the Museum by the Admiralty.

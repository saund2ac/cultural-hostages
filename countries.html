  <h3>Greece</h3>
      <p>The British Museum received a formal request in 1983 for the permanent return of all Parthenon Sculptures to Greece. While there have been discussions and media coverage of Greek government requests to borrow the sculptures, no loan request has been officially received. The Trustees of the British Museum are open to considering loan requests for any part of the collection, subject to normal conditions. However, Greek governments have consistently refused to acknowledge the Trustees' title to the Parthenon Sculptures.</p>

        <p>The British Museum has proposed a new partnership concerning the Parthenon Sculptures and is engaged in constructive discussions with colleagues in Greece. The museum maintains a positive professional relationship with the Acropolis Museum, involving scholarly workshops, staff placements, and knowledge-sharing on various subjects. The British Museum is dedicated to global collaboration, sharing and lending its collection, and working in partnership for the benefit of a diverse audience. In recent years, the museum has lent artifacts to various institutions in Athens, including the Acropolis Museum, the National Archaeological Museum, and the Museum of Cycladic Art.</p>

  <h4>Museum's Position on the Parthenon Sculptures</h4>
      <p>"The Museum takes its commitment to be a world museum seriously. The collection is a unique resource to explore the richness, diversity and complexity of all human history, our shared humanity. The strength of the collection is its breadth and depth which allows millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect â€“ whether through trade, migration, conquest, conflict, or peaceful exchange."</p>
      <p>"The Parthenon Sculptures are an integral part of that story and a vital element in this interconnected world collection, particularly in the way in which they convey the influences between Egyptian, Persian, Greek and Roman cultures. We share this collection with the widest possible public, lending objects all over the world and making images and information on over four million objects from the collection available online."</p>
      <p>"The approach of the <a href="https://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en">Acropolis Museum</a> and the British Museum are complementary: the Acropolis Museum provides an in-depth view of the ancient history of its city, the British Museum offers a sense of the wider cultural context and sustained interaction with the neighbouring civilisations of Egypt and the Near East which contributed to the unique achievements of ancient Greece."</p>


<h3>Nigeria</h3>

      <p>In October 2021, the British Museum received a written request for the return of 'Nigerian antiquities' from the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Nigeria. Additionally, representatives of the Benin Royal Palace have publicly requested the return of Benin collections, notably at the Benin Dialogue Group meeting hosted by the Museum in October 2021. These requests are part of ongoing dialogues with the Museum, including discussions during the visit of the British Museum Director to the Benin Royal Court in August 2018.
      </p>

      <p>The British Museum maintains positive relationships with the royal palace in Benin City and the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM). In August 2018, the Museum's Director, Hartwig Fischer, visited Nigeria, engaging in discussions with senior colleagues and meeting with His Royal Majesty Oba Ewuare II in Benin City. During this visit, Oba Ewuare II reiterated the request for the return of Benin collections but acknowledged the objects' role as 'cultural ambassadors' when displayed internationally.</p>

    <p>The British Museum is a member of the Benin Dialogue Group, a collaborative effort involving museum representatives from several countries and key stakeholders from Nigeria, including the Benin Royal Palace and NCMM. One of the group's key objectives is to establish new museums in Benin City to permanently showcase objects from the Kingdom of Benin, including collections currently held in UK and European museums. This initiative aims to contribute to a broader representation of historic and contemporary works from West Africa.</p>


  <h4>Museum's Position on the Benin Bronzes</h4>
      <p>"The British Museum has excellent long-term working relationships with Nigerian colleagues and institutions, particularly through the Africa Programme which has provided an important framework for colleagues to share skills and expertise. These enduring partnerships have enabled the Museum to engage in sustained and open dialogues concerning the Benin collections."</p>
      <p>"The Museum is committed to active engagement with Nigerian institutions concerning the Benin Bronzes, including pursuing and supporting new initiatives developed in collaboration with Nigerian partners and colleagues."</p>
      <p>"This includes full participation in the Benin Dialogue Group and working towards the aim of facilitating a new permanent display of Benin works of art in Benin City, to include works from the British Museum's collections. The Museum is also a fully committed partner within the <a href="https://digitalbenin.org/">Digital Benin</a> initiative, focused on developing an online tool and database to digitally reunite as many as possible of the historical objects, documents, and photographs that illuminate the Benin Kingdom."</p>
      <p>"The Museum is also committed to thorough and open investigation of Benin collection histories, and engagement with wider contemporary dialogues within which these collections are positioned. This includes fully acknowledging and understanding the colonial history which provided the key context for the development of the Museum's Benin collections."</p>

<h3>Australia</h3>

<p>After being displayed in Australia from 2015 to 2016, there have been several requests for the return of the shield to Australia. Rodney Kelly, an Aboriginal man with ancestral ties to the Sydney region, has been among those requesting the return of the shield, supported by others who share his perspective.
</p>

<p>Rodney Kelly has visited the Museum multiple times in recent years, with his most recent visits occurring in May and November 2019. During these visits, he had the opportunity to view the shield and engage in discussions with museum staff regarding his request for its return. On his last visit, Kelly expressed a desire for additional research on the shield and related objects, emphasizing collaboration with Aboriginal communities in the Sydney region and related areas. The Museum is exploring ways to support this request, recognizing the broader interest within the community for further research.
</p>

  <h4>Museum's Position on the Shield</h4>
      <p>"The Museum acknowledges that the shield, irrespective of any association with Cook, is of significance as probably the oldest known shield from Australia in any collection. In recent years it has come to symbolise British colonisation of Australia and the ongoing legacy of that colonisation."</p>
      <p>"We are aware that some communities wish to have objects on display closer to their originating community and we are always willing to see where we can collaborate to achieve this. The Museum would consider lending the shield again (subject to all our normal loan conditions)."</p>


<h3>Ethiopia</h3>
<p>Over the past five years, the British Museum has hosted various visits and delegations from Ethiopia, with notable representation, such as a visit from the Minister of Culture and Tourism, Hirut Kassaw, in March 2019. During these interactions, discussions with the Director have taken place, particularly addressing items taken from Maqdala. Requests for the return of sacred objects have been part of these conversations.
</p>

<p>Following the March 2019 meeting, the Trustees were briefed on ongoing discussions about the Maqdala material, and conversations with Ethiopian colleagues have persisted. Beyond the specific request for the return of items seized at Maqdala, broader discussions have been held regarding potential institutional collaborations.

The British Museum has a history of collaboration with the National Museum in Addis Ababa and the Institute of Ethiopian Studies, engaging in initiatives focused on skills-sharing and knowledge transfer. Colleagues from the National Museum have participated in the International Training Programme (ITP) at the British Museum.

Additionally, the British Museum maintains a longstanding and amicable relationship with senior members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, both in Ethiopia and London.
</p>

  <h4>Museum's Position on the Maqdala Collection</h4>
      <p>"Discussions with Ethiopian partners concerning the Maqdala collections are continuing and the Museum is actively invested in these. Alongside these discussions, the Museum is also committed to thorough and open investigation of Maqdala collection histories, and engagement with wider contemporary dialogues within which these collections are positioned. This includes fully acknowledging and understanding the military collection history which directly led to the Museum's Maqdala collections."</p>
      <p>"In line with earlier agreements with the church, and in light of their sacred nature, the tabots from Maqdala are not on public display. They are housed in a location specially set aside for the purpose, created and maintained in close consultation with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church."</p>
      <p>"The Museum is committed to working collaboratively with professional colleagues, members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, academics and communities associated with Ethiopia more widely to share knowledge, extend understanding and explore new perspectives on the collections from Maqdala."</p>
      <p>"The Ethiopian objects on display at the Museum emphasise and help communicate the diverse religious traditions of Ethiopia, including Christianity, Islam and Judaism as well as other faiths."</p>


<h3>Easter Island</h3>
    <p>In July 2018, Rapa Nui submitted a formal request for the repatriation of Hoa Hakananai'a and Moai Hava. Subsequently, representatives from Rapa Nui were invited to visit the Museum, and this official delegation took place in November 2018.
      </p>

      <p>In November 2018, during their visit to London, representatives of the Rapanui community extended an invitation to Museum officials to visit Rapa Nui for further discussions. This reciprocal visit occurred in June 2019, during which British Museum staff had the opportunity to explore various cultural sites, gaining insights into Rapanui culture, the significance of the statue, and the community's aspirations. Subsequent discussions have revolved around the potential development of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Museum and the Rapanui community, outlining collaborative projects. Additionally, in August 2019, the Museum received a visit from a staff member of the Father Englert Anthropological Museum in Hanga Roa, Rapa Nui, who explored the collections.

  <h4>Museum's Position on the Maoi</h4>
      <p>"The Museum recognises the significance of Hoa Hakananai'a and Moai Hava for the Rapanui community today, and acknowledges the impact of their removal from the island in 1868."</p>
      <p>"The Museum is developing a long-term relationship with the community of Rapa Nui, to bring staff time and resources to collaborative research and reinterpretation of the Rapanui collections for the benefit of the community and the wider world. Through the Memorandum of Understanding, we plan to develop mutually beneficial projects with artists, scholars and other community members in Rapa Nui."</p>
      <p>"Hoa Hakananai'a represents one of the world's great sculptural traditions, and is a witness to the global significance of Rapanui culture. Its presence increases public understanding of the history of Rapa Nui, its people's artistic achievements past, present and future, and the challenges faced by the community today. The strength of the British Museum's collection is its breadth and depth which allows millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect â€“ whether through trade, migration, conquest, peaceful exchange or other interactions â€“ both in the past and today."</p>
